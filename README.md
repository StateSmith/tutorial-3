# Initial Ease of Use Tutorial
This tutorial (#3) focuses on new and easier to use StateSmith features that have been added since the last tutorial (#2).

It requires the use of the [StateSmith.Cli tool](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/blob/main/src/StateSmith.Cli/README.md) called `ss.cli`.

With the goal of keeping things as simple as possible to start, this tutorial uses `PlantUML` as the diagram tool.

Tutorial #2 uses draw.io which is super helpful for large diagrams, but takes some time to setup with StateSmith and has a number of common gotchas.

I recommend finishing this tutorial first, and then moving on to tutorial #2 if you need more advanced features.

| Tutorial    | Diagram Tool | Program Runner       | Expansions |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------------------- | ---------- |
| Tutorial #3 | PlantUML     | ss.cli               | no         |
| Tutorial #2 | draw.io      | dotnet-script (.csx) | yes        |

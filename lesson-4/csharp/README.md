# C# - Welcome!
Full disclosure, I'm an embedded C developer that really enjoys C#. I think the C# language has a ton to offer and absolutely love the open source Roslyn compiler. That's why I wrote StateSmith in C#.

If you like StateSmith and want to help improve it, your help would be very much appreciated!

# Language specific party time 🎉 

About darn time we get to our favorite languages. Wait! What's this? It's the 🚨fuzzy logic cops!🚨

# 👮‍♀️ Concurrency Cops! 👮
> *"Hands off the keyboard! Did you just send multiple events to your state machine with no RESPECT for concurrency!?"*

Before we head on to our favorite languages, it is [important to consider concurrency](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/wiki/Concurrency).

Once you got that figured out, navigate to the directory of your desired language/framework and check the README.md there.

# More Languages Coming Soon
I'm still migrating files from tutorial 2 here.

In the mean time, see [tutorial 2 lesson 5](https://github.com/StateSmith/tutorial-2/tree/main/lesson-5) for language specific details. You don't need to run code generation again. It's already done for you. You can run/explore the projects without needing to run .csx files.
